# Ulam Spiral (Using a Fermat Spiral Mesh)

![Ulam Spiral]("./main.png")

I was inspired by a post in the Wolfram community where a user (Jari Kirma) embedded many disks along a Fermat spiral whose radius was inversely proportional to the number of prime divisors (counting multiplicity) of the integer step at that point in the spiral. I loved the structure so much that I wanted to re-create it. I don't have access to Wolfram Mathematica, so I recreated it in Python using some popular graphics libraries.

## Dependencies

1. sympy
2. numpy
3. matplotlib

## Running

Just run the script without any arguments. The default output is `main.png` and will have a size that allows 500dpi on whatever screen you are using.
